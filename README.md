# Real World RX [Video]
This is the code repository for [Real World RX [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/real-world-rx-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787287235), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The course starts by creating your first RX-ified Node app. You then move on to installing Node, Express, RXJs, SocketIO, MongoDB, Mongoose, Request, and Response. You'll also explore basic routing, integrating MongoDB and Mongoose with the app. 

You will learn how to write basic queries using Mongoose ODM, understand how RX works with Express and Mongo, and then convert everything to streams. 

This comprehensive yet easy- to- follow course will give you an understanding of socket connections and integrating Socket IO with your app. We will show you how setting up authentication, error handling, and using gravatars can be as easy as 1-2-3. Moving along, you will also cover setting up React and explore a quick overview of React and Atomic State Management. 

By the end of this course, you will have an understanding of Redux Middleware and will know how to create your own Chat interface, while also writing epic code, and executing code refactoring and error handling.
